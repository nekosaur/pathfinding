# pathfinding

Trying for a refactor of pfsandbox

## dependencies
 - com.airhacks:afterburner-topgun
 - javax.inject:javax.inject
 - com.google.guava:guava
 - it.unimi.dsi:fastutil

## thoughts
- Probably not viable, but having map and vertex be completely immutable, pathfinders keep track of local variables by themselves, use functional interfaces?
